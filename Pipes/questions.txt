A file descriptor is one field in a FILE struct.
The global variable stdin is of type FILE *.
The file descriptor for standard output has the value 1.

The pipe call must be made before the fork call because the child inherits open file descriptors from the parent.
Pipes are unidirectional, meaning that you cannot use the same pipe to both write data to another process and to read data from that process.

Who ensures that one process cannot be reading from the pipe at the same time as another process is writing to the pipe? the operating system

A write call will block if the pipe is full.

dup2 is used when you want to reset standard input for a process to read from a file.
dup2 takes two indices in the file descriptor table and resets one to refer to the same file object as the other.

It is important to close all file descriptors for writing on a pipe except the one that we plan to use because... the read end of the pipe won't know when all the data has been sent until all write descriptors are closed.

Open file descriptors are inherited across the fork call. We have to call fork after pipe for the pipe to have the right file descriptors open in both processes.
