A file descriptor is one field in a FILE struct.
The global variable stdin is of type FILE *.
The file descriptor for standard output has the value 1.

The pipe call must be made before the fork call because the child inherits open file descriptors from the parent.
Pipes are unidirectional, meaning that you cannot use the same pipe to both write data to another process and to read data from that process.
