When we allocate memory we need to provide the size of the block of memory we need. 
When we call free, we provide the address of the block of memory we are deallocating.
An ENOMEM error occurs when the program runs out of memory.
Select the true statements about any program that defines the following C function, and calls it in main.

void helper(int *arr) {
    arr = malloc(sizeof(int));
}
arr might be an array of integers or it might be a single pointer to an integer. 
This code has a memory leak.
arr is local to helper and is not returned. 

The expression *p[0] is the same as p[0][0].
We typically free the pieces of a nested data-structure from the "bottom-up".
Memory left allocated on the heap at the end of a running program is automatically deallocated.
