Local variables for functions are stored in the: Stack
A single stack frame stores local variables and arguments for: one function call
The Code Segment starts at an address that is: close to but not zero
A variable assigned outside of main (and not inside another function) is accessible in: The main function and any other functions
Global variables are not stored in the stack because: The stack contains only variables that are defined within functions, and they would only be accessible in the stack frame in which they were declared -- not globally.
Dynamically-allocated data is stored in: The heap.
